        <![CDATA[<br><br>]]>This is my Art, Quality over Quantity so be patience pls and thanks to all who are patient!.
   </string>

    <string name="warning_hook_ad_analytics" translatable="false">This will attempt to disable the analytics libraries from being loaded into the application. This does not support all (80+) right now, so be patient until I get around to all of them. If analytics are still being loaded in or ads are still appearing, it means they are not supported for now. This can also cause applications to crash if they heavily depend on the analytics/ad library. IF Application Crashes go into the New HOOK UI and disable some of the Ad Analytics Hooks test app rinse and repeat until you find the Hook that is crashing it. I WILL not help with this as Disabling ads and analytics can crash some apps so figure out your self what is causing it disable it!</string>
    <string name="warning_hook_ad_analytics_spoof" translatable="false">This will not disable the analytics/ad libraries from being loaded in but will spoof unique/critical IDs and/or keys within the library to make analytics more difficult.</string>
    <string name="warning_hook_embed_paypal" translatable="false">This will attempt to spoof the environment to help trick PayPal payment gateways within apps into thinking the phone is not rooted or an emulator. This is an attempt, not bulletproof.</string>
    <string name="warning_hook_get_app" translatable="false">This will prevent the action of getting single application data. It will not filter the list of applications but will intercept the functions that can get single pieces of data on the target application, thus revealing that the app exists. HMA (Hide My App List) will block and filter the lists. This will cover everything else that is not listing apps but getting something from an app. You can have whitelist mode or blacklist mode, controlled in settings.</string>
    <string name="warning_hook_get_apps_ex" translatable="false">Using this will most likely block all applications to be seen except usually the current app being hooked. That being said I was too behind to sit here and implement all these APIs to the new system from M66Bs so as an option you can select this instead of the Get.Apps Hooks I have made. No need to use both as this one will most likely override the other and display nothing versus the other one using a filter. Do not ask about this Hook or that I should update it , as I am aware and working on it so be patient or use Get.Apps Combined with HMA (Hide my applist) thanks!.</string>
    <string name="warning_hook_get_location" translatable="false">Get Location will allow control over the target application if it is allowed to get the location versus spoofing it. Spoof Location will imply that you allow it to get the location, but you want to spoof it.</string>
    <string name="warning_hook_gsm_status" translatable="false">These hooks will only spoof the state of data, showing it as enabled despite being disabled.</string>
    <string name="warning_hook_hide_environment" translatable="false">This hook will attempt to hide if the system is an emulator and/or is rooted. By no means is this bulletproof or even super effective, especially if the target app uses native detection methods. Do not complain if it does not hide for some apps. To ensure it works the best, select the (Intercept Shell, Intercept Properties, and Get Apps) hooks. Combine Get Apps with HMA (Hide My App List). The Get Apps hook, if whitelist mode is enabled, will automatically block my hardcoded list of root packages. To ensure strength, add your own list in settings. Finally, in settings, enable (hide.root) and (hide.emulator).</string>
    <string name="warning_hook_id_user" translatable="false">Enabling this will spoof the user via Activity Manager but not using the command `whoami`. To ensure this works, enable the `whoami` command intercept in settings, then select the Intercept Shell hook group. The Activity Manager method will also only be useful for applications that have higher-level privileges, either via system or root.</string>
    <string name="warning_hook_intercept_shell" translatable="false">You can control the commands it will intercept (hardcoded) in the settings UI containing shell. If the app uses native shell, this hook will not work.</string>
    <string name="warning_hook_language" translatable="false">This may not always work and can be unstable at times, as it targets many APIs that can be used for legitimate reasons. If you notice odd behavior in the application, disable this hook.</string>
    <string name="warning_hook_properties" translatable="false">To control the interception filter, use the Properties UI. This hook currently does not support native build proper properties interception. If the property is still being intercepted despite your filter configuration, assume they are using native methods.</string>
    <string name="warning_hook_soc_ex" translatable="false">This hook can cause applications to crash on certain versions of Android and/or devices. Disable this if you experience issues with the application crashing. Enable only this hook, open the app, and see if it causes the application to crash.</string>
    <string name="warning_hook_spoof_features" translatable="false">Enabling this hook can cause odd behavior in the application, such as possible connection issues. This filter removes all device features for now. When applications use this function to check if you have a camera or Wi-Fi chip, it will appear as if you do not, since those are considered features.</string>
    <string name="warning_hook_user_agent" translatable="false">If you have installed a custom WebView on the device, such as BroMite, this hook may not work as expected. It will still work on applications that use OkHttp3, HttpUrlConnection, and GeckoWebView from Firefox. These hooks will not work on Chromium-based browsers, such as Chrome and Brave, since they use native code to build their user agents. Lastly, using this on apps like DoorDash is unwise, as DoorDash uses its own type of user agent. If you do not spoof it correctly, it can make DoorDash flag you.</string>
    <string name="warning_hook_vpn_state" translatable="false">This will hide the fact that you have a VPN enabled and connected. However, if the target application uses server-side methods to detect the VPN, it cannot be bypassed via hooks. This hook is a local detection bypass using four methods.</string>


    <string name="title_hook_warning" translatable="false">Hook Group Warning!</string>

    <string name="title_help_installed">Restriction installed</string>
