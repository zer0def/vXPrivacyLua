# XPL-EX Documentation

---

## üìå Introduction

Welcome! This documentation is designed to help you get the most out of **XPL-EX**. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned power user, this guide covers all major areas clearly and effectively.

Over time, we've added help dialogs, examples, tooltips, and contextual menus. Your role as the user is to **read**, **explore**, and **experiment**. If you're asking questions that can be answered by a tooltip, the help menu, or a quick Google search (e.g., *"What is an MCC?"*), you‚Äôll be redirected here.<br><br>
Selecting ALL Hooks at Once is a FOOLISH Choice and WILL be Ignored if you have Issues, Select what you Need or you think you need. Every app is Different, if the Hook Group Selected Causes a Crash you know now not to use it...<br>

Please be respectful of the time invested in building this tool ‚Äî use the resources made available to you first before asking questions.

> üß† TL;DR: Click, read, debug, Google ‚Äî then ask.

## üîí Laziness Policy (Randomization & Expectations)

XPL-EX is a **gatekeeper**, not a babysitter. While we provide tools such as one-click randomizers, we do **not** perform value validation, cross-checks against databases, or automatic configuration updates.

### ‚ùó Why?

Implementing a randomizer that outputs realistic values would require:

1. Building and maintaining a full database of valid device info
2. Cross-validating each setting against others
3. Handling edge cases like custom spoofing values

This is **outside the scope** of XPL-EX.

> Use `%random%` for quick outputs ‚Äî but if you want realism, research it yourself.

* Want a Samsung Note 9 profile? Google:

  * `Samsung Note 9 build.prop`
  * `Samsung Note 9 SoC`
* Then input those values manually.

**We DO provide randomizers** for most common non-unique fields (e.g., Model, Build Date). However, we do not support:

* Complex cross-checked device configurations
* Requests to add specific devices
* Complaints about unrealistic outputs from randomization

> üì£ If it‚Äôs not used to uniquely identify you, stop obsessing over it. Focus on what matters.

### üåÄ How `%random%` Works

When you assign `%random%` as a value to a setting, this instructs XPL-EX to replace that placeholder with a randomly generated value **at runtime ‚Äî before the target app starts**. Each time the app stops and starts again, this process is repeated.

However, this only works **if the setting has a valid randomizer assigned**. You can verify this by:

* Clicking the Randomize button ‚Äî if it says **"No Randomizer Selected"**, there's no valid randomizer.
* Checking the current randomizer name ‚Äî if it's set to **`[Select Randomizer]`**, then none has been assigned.

In these cases, `%random%` will do nothing.

### ‚ùå Why No Cross-Check Randomizers?

Creating cross-consistent random values would require:

* Linking one setting‚Äôs random output to others
* Having a backend database that maps valid combinations
* Continual maintenance as new devices and Android versions emerge

That‚Äôs a huge undertaking ‚Äî and not our focus.

Instead, **we provide randomized outputs for all unique settings** and most general settings where applicable. For the rest:

* Use the provided **descriptions and examples** in the UI
* Explore outputs from existing randomizers for inspiration
* Manually fill in values using realistic examples

<br><br>
## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings UI

This is where you control spoofed values used by hooks. Example: Android ID, DRM ID, Ad ID, etc.

Hooks read values from here. No value = no spoofing.

## üåê Global vs App Context

In XPL-EX, every setting can exist in two contexts:

* **Global Context**: This applies universally across all apps. It provides default values for any setting that hasn't been overridden per app.
* **App Context**: These are per-app overrides. If you assign a value for a setting in an app‚Äôs context, it takes priority over the global value.

### üîÑ Priority Behavior

When an app accesses a value that a hook is intercepting:

1. XPL-EX checks if there is a **per-app value (App Context)** set for that setting.
2. If **none is found**, it falls back to the **Global Context**.
3. If neither has a value, the hook will effectively do nothing or return default behavior.

### üß™ Example Scenario

Let‚Äôs say you have the `ANDROID_ID` hook enabled for App A:

* You assign `ANDROID_ID = 123abc` in Global Context.
* But you assign `ANDROID_ID = 789xyz` in App Context for App A.
* **Result**: When App A runs, it will use `789xyz` ‚Äî the per-app value.

If you delete the per-app value:

* App A will now use `123abc`, the global value.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If a spoofed value doesn‚Äôt seem to apply, check both contexts. The App Context always overrides Global.

### üîß Best Practices

* Use Global to define common baseline values
* Only use App Context when specific apps need unique identities
* Don‚Äôt duplicate values across both contexts unnecessarily

## üß© Hooks UI

Found under \[4.10] in the main menu.

Here you can:

* View all available hooks
* Use help dialogs
* Create or edit hooks

> This section is for advanced users. Proceed only if you know what you‚Äôre doing.

---

## üéâ Final Thoughts

You‚Äôre in full control. XPL-EX gives you the tools, but how you use them is up to you.

* Don't blindly randomize ‚Äî understand what you‚Äôre spoofing. (If its Unique Fuck it Randomize it all whenever)
* Use the help dialogs. They‚Äôre there for a reason.
* Share configs. Learn by experimenting.

> üîê Power comes with responsibility ‚Äî and documentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Reporting Errors & Obtaining Logs

When reporting an issue, proper logs are essential to diagnose the problem. Follow the steps below to ensure you're providing the correct information:

### ‚úÖ What to Include When Reporting

* Name of the **target app** experiencing issues
* The **specific Hook Group** or Hook causing the problem
* A list of **Hooks enabled** for that app
* **Logcat logs** or **Settings UI logs** for the session

### üìÑ Getting Logcat Logs

1. Install **Logcat Reader** (package name: `com.dp.logcatapp`) from your preferred app store.
2. Open the app and:

   * Tap the **three-dot menu** (top-right)
   * Tap **"Clear"** to start with a clean log
3. Use the **search icon** and search for: `xlua`
4. Reproduce the issue in the app
5. Return to Logcat Reader:

   * Tap the three-dot menu again
   * Tap **"Save"**
   * Share that saved log file along with your report

> üîç Use keywords like `xlua` to isolate relevant entries from XPL-EX within large logs.

### üß™ Alternative Log Methods

If Logcat Reader does not work:

* Use **ADB logcat** via command line:

  ```bash
  adb logcat -v time > /sdcard/xplex_log.txt
  ```
or More Specific:
  ```bash
  logcat | grep -iE -B10 -A10 'XLua' &>> /sdcard/xplex_log.txt
  ```
Command will Vary and Can, You may need to exit aka with the Command use your Brain or Uninstall Android / Root. <br>

  Reproduce the issue, then stop the log and attach `xplex_log.txt` to your report.
* Try other apps such as **MatLog**, **Logcat Extreme**, or **Bug Report Reader* If your using Command Line use a Valid Path, Arguments, Perhaps use ROOT (SU) instead of ADB*. 

Do **not** assume a tool failure means you cannot report the issue. Use alternatives.

### üßæ Settings UI Logs

XPL-EX includes non-error logs visible in the **Settings UI > App Island > Logs** section:

* These show changes made to settings
* Hook values replaced (old ‚Üí new)
* Can be used for understanding behavior or confirming spoofing took place

---

## üß± Debugging, Behavior Limits, and Expected Results

### ‚öôÔ∏è Native vs Java Hooking Limitations

As of **6/12/24**, XPL-EX **does not support native method hooking**. If an app retrieves values using native code (e.g., via `libc`, `fopen`, `__system_property_get`, or native `exec getprop`), XPL-EX will **not** intercept or spoof these.

#### üß™ Common Signs of Native-Only Behavior

* You‚Äôve set the correct hooks and spoofed values, but the app shows no change
* Known native-heavy apps like **Chrome**, **Brave**, or other Chromium browsers do not reflect spoofed user agents

> üö´ If it happens in the native layer, XPL-EX cannot spoof it (yet).

Use logic and known app behavior to infer whether a detail is natively fetched. Due to time and scale, the XPL-EX team cannot analyze every app.

---

### üîÑ Wrong Value Being Spoofed? Try This

If a value appears spoofed but isn‚Äôt what you expected ‚Äî test deliberately.

#### üß™ Example Diagnostic

Assume you're trying to spoof device info:

1. Go into **XPL-EX > Settings**
2. Assign values like:

   * `device.manufacturer = dog`
   * `device.brand = cat`
   * `device.model = snake`
3. Open the target app and check how the information is displayed

> If your values appear, you‚Äôve confirmed which setting was used. If not, the app may be pulling data differently.

---

### üêõ LSPosed Settings Storage Checkbox

Sometimes in **LSPosed > XPL-EX scope**, you‚Äôll see the `Settings Storage` module **unchecked** even though you selected it previously.

* This is likely a bug within LSPosed or a side effect of how XPL-EX interacts with it.
* If you‚Äôre unsure, **select `Settings Storage` again and reboot**.

> ‚úÖ As long as it was checked at least once and you‚Äôve rebooted, you should be fine ‚Äî even if it appears unchecked later.

Keep this in mind to avoid confusion during setup.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated Collections Warning

If your issue originates from the old `Privacy` collection or outdated builds:

* üõë No support will be provided
* Migrate to the updated `PrivacyEx` collection instead

If you‚Äôve **manually modified** a hook and now face issues:

* We cannot help debug custom logic. Ensure your hook was not altered incorrectly.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Missed Hook Warnings

Some Hook Groups display **Warning Messages** when selected. Always select Hook Groups **one by one** to ensure you:

* Trigger these warnings
* Understand potential side effects

Failure to read warnings or blindly selecting every Hook Group ‚Äî then reporting crashes ‚Äî will result in your report being ignored.

> üì£ TL;DR: Provide app name, hook info, logcat logs (via app or ADB), and pay attention to warnings!
